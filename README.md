# Web Design Challenge

### Build / Host a website called "latitude"
Populate it with analysis with climate conditions as they relate to distance from the Equator

### Push previously analyzed weather data to a website for superior digital shareability

* `sample.image` is < describe image >
* In folder, `assets`/`css` are the following 6 tables:
    1. `style.css` is a css style sheet
    2. `sample_data.csv` is < describe contents >
   
* In folder, `assets`/`images` are the following 5 images:
    1. `CloudinessInWorldCities.png` is a scatter plot of Cloudiness in relation to the equator
    2. `Humidity_Heatmap.png` is a heatmap of humidity measurements over a world map
    3. `HumidityInWorldCities.png` is a a scatter plot of Humidity in relation to the equator
    4. `TemperatureInWorldCities.png` is a scatter plot of Temperatures in relation to the equator
    5. `WindSpeedInWorldCities.png` is a scatter plot of Wind speed in relation to the equator
    
* In folder, `Resources` are the following 6 tables:
    1. `city_data.csv` is a table containing climate measurements from randomly generated cities around the globe
    2. `hotel_df.csv` is a table of hotels nearest the city centers using lat and long coordinates

* In folder, `Visualizations` are the following html files:
    1. `cloudiness.html` is a scatter plot of Cloudiness in relation to the equator
    2. `humidity.html` is a heatmap of humidity measurements over a world map
    3. `temperature.html` is a a scatter plot of Humidity in relation to the equator
    4. `windspeed.html` is a scatter plot of Temperatures in relation to the equator

### Observations:
* < List Observations Here >
* The relationship is inverse.
* Engineer, Asst Engineer, Senior Engineer have similar AVG Salaries, with Senior Engineers making the least of the group. Meanwhile Senior Staff as well as general Staff, both AVG nearly 12,000 more. Also, from our previous examples, there are an awful lot of women named Hercules B____, which seems improbable.
* Either something is wrong, or this company data is fictional.
